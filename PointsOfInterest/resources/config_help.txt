This file contains all the information you need to accurately set up
the PointsOfInterest plugin.

You might wonder why this help is not contained within the config 
file.  Simply put this makes upgrades easier.  By keeping the instructions
separate, I can easily bring your config file up to date next time you start
your server without losing your old settings.

All configuration keys have a default value, and if you ever want to return
to the default value, you can just remove the key entirely from your config
file.  The next time you start the server, the default value will be used and
the config file will be rewritten to include that value for you.  If you want
all default values, you can delete the file entirely.  It will be recreated
with default values the next time you start the server.

Your config file is named "config.yml" and should be in the same folder as this
file.  If this file has been moved, then you can find your "config.yml" under:

	{your_bukkit_folder}/plugins/PointsOfInterest
	

Finally, all configuration keys must be typed exactly as you see here.  They are
case sensitive.  Also, do not use tabs in the config file; only use spaces.  If 
you use tabs, the plugin will be sad and you will get all default config values.
An error will also show up in your server logs to let you know that there was a
problem loading the config file.

The remainder of this file contains the configuration details in the following format:

-------------
configKey: exampleValue
-------------

	Some information about what this controls.
	
	Type: What type of value to use
	Default: The default value
	
	
-------------
distanceThreshold: 2000
-------------

	Controls the maximum search radius and the maximum distance at which
	a player can get directions to a POI. Set to a value of -1 for "unlimited"

	Type: Whole Number
	Default: 2000

------------
minPoiGap: 50
-------------

	Controls the minimum distance between POIs.  A player will not be able to create
    a POI within this distance of another POI.

    Type: Whole Number, not negative
    Default: 50
    

---------------
maxSearchResults: 10
---------------

    Maximum number of results that will be returned when player 
    searches for nearby POIs.

    Type: Whole Number, larger than 0 (zero)
    Default: 10
    

----------------
maxPlayerPoiPerWorld: 10
----------------

    Maximum number of POIs each player can create in each world. If this value
    is reduced and a player has already created more than the new max, the player
    will NOT be forced to clean up the excess POIs.  It is recommended that this number
    starts lower and is only increased.

    Type: Whole Number, larger than 0 (zero)
    Default: 10
    

----------------    
worldBlacklist: [world1, world_nether, otherWorld]
----------------

    A list of worlds which do not allow POIs. If a world with existing POIs is added
    to the black list, those POIs will NOT be automatically deleted; however, players 
    (including POI owners) will not be able to see nor interact with the POIs within
    that world.  If the world is removed from the blacklist, the POIs will become
    available to the players again.

    Type: Comma seperated list of world names, enclosed in square brackets [ ]
    Default: none
